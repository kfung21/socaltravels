# Channel Islands: The Galapagos Nobody Visits

The Channel Islands sit close enough to the Ventura coast that you can see them on clear days, yet far enough that visiting feels like traveling to another country. The boat ride over can range from smooth sailing to "why did I eat breakfast," but once you land on Santa Cruz Island and stand on the cliffs above Scorpion Bay watching island foxes trot past like tiny, fearless dogs, the crossing is immediately forgiven.

Painted Cave on the north side of Santa Cruz is one of the world's largest sea caves — over 1,200 feet deep. Kayaking into its mouth as the bioluminescence lights up the water beneath you is the kind of experience people describe in ways that make their friends think they're exaggerating. They're not.

## Planning It

Book the Island Packers boat from Ventura Harbor well in advance. Day trips to Santa Cruz or Anacapa work fine, but camping overnight on the island is where the real experience lives — sunset over the Pacific with no light pollution, no cell service, and the sound of waves echoing off sea cliffs.

## The Wildlife

Island foxes are endemic — they exist nowhere else. They're about the size of a house cat and have zero fear of humans. The seabird colonies on Anacapa are massive and loud. Whale watching from the boat crossing adds marine mammals to the list. It's biodiversity that rivals parks ten times its fame.
