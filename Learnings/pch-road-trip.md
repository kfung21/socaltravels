# PCH: The Drive That Ruins All Other Drives

Pacific Coast Highway is the road that makes you understand why people buy convertibles. From Malibu south through the beach cities, past Palos Verdes, down to Dana Point and into San Diego County, PCH strings together some of the best coastline views in the state and somehow manages to feel like a different world from the freeways running parallel just a mile inland.

The Malibu stretch is the headliner — cliff-hugging turns above the ocean, El Matador State Beach pulloffs, and the Point Dume overlook. The South Bay section through Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo is the classic SoCal beach town cruise. The Orange County section from Huntington through Laguna Beach is postcard territory. And the stretch into Carlsbad and Encinitas in north San Diego County has some of the best surf breaks in SoCal.

## The Logistics

The full Malibu-to-San Diego run is technically possible in a day but you'll want to stop every 20 minutes, so plan for a full day or split it into two. Weekday mornings have less traffic. Weekend PCH through Malibu in summer moves at the speed of frustration.

## Best Stops

El Matador Beach (Malibu), Leo Carrillo State Park, Point Dume, Manhattan Beach pier, Crystal Cove State Park (Newport Coast), Laguna Beach downtown, Dana Point Harbor, and the Carlsbad flower fields in spring.
