# San Diego: A Taco Tour Field Report

San Diego's proximity to the border means the taco game here operates at a level that most American cities can't touch. This is where the Baja-style fish taco was effectively introduced to the US, and the city has spent decades building on that foundation with every regional Mexican style represented somewhere within city limits.

The classic fish taco — beer-battered, white sauce, cabbage, on a corn tortilla — is the gateway. But the real depth is in the birria spots in Chula Vista and National City, the street-style taco carts in Barrio Logan, the Oaxacan tlayudas popping up across the county, and the Baja Med fusion that treats the border as a suggestion rather than a boundary.

## The Highlights

The fish taco debate is eternal and personal. The street taco scene in South Bay is where locals eat. The birria movement hit San Diego hard and the quesabirria options are everywhere now. And any taco shop that's been open since before Instagram existed is probably doing something right.

## Cross the Border

Tijuana's food scene has exploded. Walk across at San Ysidro, grab tacos at any stand in the Zona Centro, and you'll understand why San Diegans consider TJ an extension of their own food scene.
