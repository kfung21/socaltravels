# Anza-Borrego: When the Desert Decides to Show Off

A desert superbloom is what happens when the right amount of rain hits the right soil at the right temperature and the desert floor decides, collectively, to remind everyone that it's been hiding an entire wildflower ecosystem under that cracked, dry surface the whole time. Anza-Borrego does this better than anywhere in SoCal — fields of desert sunflower, sand verbena, and desert lily that stretch to the horizon and turn the brown badlands into something that looks aggressively Photoshopped.

The thing about superblooms is they're unpredictable. Some years the desert barely bothers. Other years it goes so hard that it makes national news and suddenly there are 100,000 people trying to fit on the same two-lane road into Borrego Springs. The park actually has a wildflower hotline you can call to check conditions, which is the most wholesome government service in California.

## Timing

February through April, but only after sufficient winter rain. Follow the Anza-Borrego Foundation's bloom reports. Peak bloom can last as little as two weeks.

## The Metal Sculptures

Even without flowers, the Ricardo Breceda sculptures scattered across the desert are worth the drive. Giant metal serpents, raptors, and prehistoric creatures rising from the sand. Free, 24/7, and genuinely surreal at sunrise.
