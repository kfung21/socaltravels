# Death Valley: Hot Enough to Question Physics

There's a thermometer at Furnace Creek that regularly shows numbers your oven uses for baking. Death Valley holds the record at 134°F, but the "normal" summer high of 120°F is plenty enough to make you reconsider the meaning of outdoor recreation. The air feels like opening a dryer. Your car's dashboard burns to the touch. Water evaporates from your water bottle visibly. It's a physics experiment you're living inside.

But visit in November through March? Death Valley transforms into one of the most hauntingly beautiful landscapes in North America. Zabriskie Point at sunrise paints the badlands in golds and purples. Badwater Basin — the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level — stretches into an infinity of salt flats. Artist's Palette serves up geological colors that look Photoshopped. Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes at golden hour are the most photographed dunes in the country for good reason.

## The Timing Matters

Winter is the only reasonable season. Daytime highs in the 60s–70s, cold nights perfect for camping, and the clearest air you'll find in California. Spring wildflower superbloom years (after wet winters) are the special event — carpets of gold and purple across the valley floor.

## What I Learned

Bring twice the water you think you need. Your car needs to be reliable — breakdowns in Death Valley in summer can be genuinely life-threatening. Tell someone your itinerary. And the stars at night, far from any city, rival Joshua Tree.
