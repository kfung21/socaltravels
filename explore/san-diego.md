San Diego is what happens when a city decides its entire personality should be "perfect weather and good vibes" and then actually delivers on it. The beaches are wide and warm, the taco scene is legitimately world-class (Baja-style fish tacos were essentially born here), the craft beer industry treats hops like religion, and the San Diego Zoo is a genuine bucket-list experience that will make you feel sorry for every other zoo you've ever visited.

The Gaslamp Quarter is the downtown nightlife hub, but the real SD is in the neighborhoods — Ocean Beach for the hippie surfer energy, La Jolla for the sea caves and seals, North Park for the craft beer crawl, and Coronado for the beach and the Hotel del Coronado that's been hosting guests since 1888. Balboa Park is Central Park with better weather and a dozen museums.

## Good to Know

**Border**: Tijuana is 20 minutes south. Bring your passport and walk across for some of the best street food on the continent.

**Parking**: Downtown meters are aggressive. Use the trolley from Old Town or park in residential Hillcrest and walk down.

**Water Temp**: Pacific water here is warmer than NorCal but still not tropical. Wetsuits are common October through May.
