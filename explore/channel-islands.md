Five islands sitting off the Ventura coast that somehow feel more remote than places ten times farther from civilization. Santa Cruz is the big one — Painted Cave is one of the largest sea caves in the world and kayaking through it is genuinely jaw-dropping. Anacapa is the smallest accessible island with the iconic lighthouse and nesting seabirds. Santa Rosa has the rare Torrey pines and white sand beaches that look Caribbean if you squint.

These islands are home to species found nowhere else on Earth — the island fox, island scrub jay, and a whole ecosystem that evolved in isolation for thousands of years. It's the least-visited national park in California, which means you get a national park experience without the national park crowds.

## Good to Know

**Boat Only**: Island Packers out of Ventura is the concessioner. Book weeks in advance, especially for summer camping trips.

**Seasickness**: The channel crossing can get rough. Take Dramamine. No shame in it.

**Bring Everything**: No services on the islands. No water, no food, no stores. Pack it all in, pack it all out.
