La Jolla is San Diego's crown jewel — a stretch of coastline so photogenic it makes the rest of Southern California briefly insecure. The sea caves at La Jolla Coves are kayak-accessible and absolutely stunning. The Ecological Reserve has the best shore snorkeling in SoCal with garibaldi, leopard sharks, and visibility that can hit 30+ feet on good days. And the harbor seals at Children's Pool have staged a permanent takeover that's been the subject of decades of legal battles, which they are obviously winning.

The village itself is upscale but walkable — art galleries, restaurants, and the Birch Aquarium at Scripps perched on the hillside above. Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve just north offers clifftop trails above one of the best beaches in California, and the Torrey Pines Gliderport is where paragliders launch off the cliffs and you can watch for free while questioning your own courage.

## Good to Know

**Parking**: The village is a nightmare on weekends. Park on the residential streets uphill and walk down, or use the free Scripps pier lot and stroll along the coast.

**Snorkeling**: La Jolla Cove is best in late summer when visibility peaks. Leopard sharks at La Jolla Shores June–September — they're harmless, you're fine.
