Los Angeles is not one city — it's 88 cities and 270+ neighborhoods wearing a trenchcoat. Nobody "sees LA" in a weekend, but people try anyway and end up stuck on the 405 wondering why they didn't go to San Diego instead. The trick is picking a neighborhood and committing. Griffith Park and the Observatory give you the best views of both the Hollywood Sign and the city sprawl. The Getty Center is world-class and free. LACMA's urban light installation is the most photographed spot in the county. And the food scene — Korean BBQ in Koreatown, Oaxacan moles in Boyle Heights, birria tacos in South LA, sushi on Sawtelle — is the most diverse dining in North America.

Skip Hollywood Boulevard unless you enjoy being disappointed. Venice Beach is worth the walk. Santa Monica Pier is fine for an hour. But the real LA is in Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Highland Park, and the SGV dim sum circuit.

## Good to Know

**Traffic**: It's not a stereotype, it's a lifestyle. Avoid the 405 between 3–7pm unless you enjoy staring at brake lights. Use Metro where you can.

**Neighborhoods**: LA is its neighborhoods. Pick 2–3 per day maximum. Trying to hit Hollywood, Venice, Downtown, and Pasadena in one day is how you spend 6 hours in a car.

**The Weather**: Yes, it's always nice. No, you still need a jacket at night. Marine layer is real.
