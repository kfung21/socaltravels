Big Bear is proof that Southern California has mountains and actual snow, which comes as a genuine surprise to people who think SoCal is just beaches and freeways. Two ski resorts — Bear Mountain and Snow Summit — provide legitimate winter skiing that's close enough to LA for a day trip, though the drive up Highway 18 in a snowstorm will test your commitment to fresh powder.

Summer turns the lake into a full recreation zone: kayaking, paddleboarding, fishing, and mountain biking trails through the San Bernardino National Forest. The Alpine Pedal Path is a paved lakeside trail perfect for families. And the Village has enough restaurants and shops to make a weekend feel like a proper getaway without the price tag of Mammoth or Tahoe.

## Good to Know

**Chains**: Required in winter. CalTrans will turn you around. Buy them before the mountain — the roadside sellers charge tourist prices.

**Summer**: Water levels in the lake vary by year. Check conditions for boating and fishing.
