Joshua Tree sits at the intersection of the Mojave and Colorado deserts, which sounds like a geography textbook until you're standing in it at sunset watching the rock formations turn gold and the twisted Joshua trees cast shadows that look like they were drawn by Tim Burton. The park is a rock climber's paradise — over 8,000 climbing routes — but even if your idea of climbing is walking up stairs, the landscape is surreal enough to justify the drive from LA.

The night sky here is the real headliner. Joshua Tree is an International Dark Sky Park, which means on a clear night you can see the Milky Way so clearly it looks fake. City people have been known to pull over on Park Boulevard and just stare upward for 20 minutes, questioning why they pay $3,000/month rent to look at light pollution.

## Good to Know

**Water**: There is none in the park. Bring all of it. Then bring more. This is not a suggestion.

**Temperature**: Spring (March–May) is perfect — wildflower season if the rains cooperate. Summer is 110°F+ and genuinely dangerous. Winter nights drop below freezing.

**Camping**: Nine campgrounds, most first-come-first-served. Show up Thursday afternoon for a weekend spot. Jumbo Rocks is the classic.
