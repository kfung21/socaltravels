# About SoCal Travels

## Everything to see in Southern California.

Southern California packs beaches, deserts, mountains, and islands into a region where you can surf in the morning, ski in the afternoon, and watch the sunset from a desert hot spring — all in the same day. It's a landscape of extremes that somehow all coexist within a few hours' drive of each other.

## What Makes SoCal Different

**The Beaches** — From Malibu's sea stacks to La Jolla's coves to Coronado's wide sand, SoCal's coastline runs 200+ miles of PCH-accessible beach towns, surfing breaks, and tide pools. The water's warmer than NorCal (not that that's a high bar), and the beach culture is a genuine lifestyle, not just a weekend activity.

**The Deserts** — Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Anza-Borrego, and the Mojave. Two distinct desert ecosystems, the hottest place on Earth, some of the best stargazing in the country, and spring wildflower superblooms that make the internet lose its mind.

**Los Angeles & San Diego** — Two of America's largest cities with food scenes, cultural institutions, and neighborhoods that could each fill a guidebook. Korean BBQ in Koreatown, fish tacos in San Diego, the Getty, Balboa Park, Griffith Observatory, and enough diversity on a single block to represent a dozen countries.

**The Mountains** — Big Bear and Mt. Baldy offer skiing two hours from the beach. The San Gabriel Mountains provide wilderness hiking within sight of downtown LA. Mt. San Jacinto rises 10,800 feet above the Coachella Valley floor.

**The Islands** — Channel Islands National Park sits just off the coast but feels like a different continent. Sea caves, endemic wildlife, and the kind of isolation you can't find on the mainland.

**Palm Springs & the Desert Cities** — Mid-century architecture, poolside culture, the aerial tramway, and the Coachella Valley stretching east into the badlands.

## What This Site Covers

National parks, state parks, beaches, deserts, cities, mountain towns, islands, and the drives that connect them. Location profiles with honest info, photo galleries, and links to [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) for maps and navigation.

Blog posts covering the real experience — logistics, timing, what to expect, and the things you wish someone had told you before you drove 3 hours to find a closed road and a full parking lot.

## Where SoCal Starts

For this site, "Southern California" means everything south of the Monterey/Fresno line — San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, the Central Coast, Los Angeles, the Inland Empire, the deserts, San Diego, and the Channel Islands. SLO County and the southern Central Valley are SoCal. Everything above that line lives on [NorCal Travels](https://norcaltravels.com).
